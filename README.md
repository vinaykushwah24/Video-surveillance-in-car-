Video surveillance in car can be done by two or three method here i have done using option 1 and 2 but there is third option also available on which i am working on. The hardware for video straming is Raspberry pi and HD webcame. 
1> By using specific duration of video upload to cloud using shell script
2> Live video sharing
  1> Using Motion (For access video globly we need to do port forwarding of IP address  )
  2> Using Youtube streaming
  3> Using VLC
  4> Using Thrird party software
3> Give last 15 min video recording at any time to the user at local storage and as well as cloud also.
